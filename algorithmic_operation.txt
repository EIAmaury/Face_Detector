whats happening behind this code?
what is "haar_cascades"?
A haar_cascades is a algorithm which we use to identify objects or image.
This multiple classifier in cascades with positive and negative examples of an image.
The Haar cascade classifier uses a set of features to identify objects,
such as edges, lines, and corners, and applies them to different regions of an image.
It then uses these features to classify whether a region contains the object of interest or not.

Haar_features:subtracting the sum of pixel intensities in one region of an image from the sum of pixel intensities in another region.
there are edge,line,four-rectangles features.
these features are used to identify object
how darker and brighter is region of an image than an another region
we use grayscale because color is no relevant for brightness

Training data
positive images and negatives images
to supervisedd learning
find the winning haar features, better match
we try every Haar_features on every training image
every type,localisation,size
return the substraction beetween the two region
below 50 is wrong
